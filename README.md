# CAY-algorithm

## Overview
- The CAY-algorithm is the code-base for the CelloBot project by C.A.Y, a team for PS9888 Making and Tinkering at the Nanyang Technological University.
- The CelloBot is an autonomous, battery-operated hand-held device designed to read sheet music. The sheet music to be read must first be prepared by overlaying small 2mm by 2mm 2-dimensional code. It was our team's design objective to shrink such codes to be invisble to the naked eye while providing enough information for music retrieval. 
- The CAY-algorithm consists of 3 distinct parts:
	1. Image processing on [OpenMV H7 Cam](https://openmv.io/products/openmv-cam-h7)
	2. Web server on [ESPRESSIF ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32_datasheet_en.pdf)
	3. Utilities on Linux / arbitrary computer
